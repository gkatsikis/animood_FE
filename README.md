## Inspiration

This project was dedicated to my friend who is constantly trying to get me to watch her depressing anime recommendations. She insists that they are "the good kind of crying" and I should give them a shot. I realized it was hard to differentiate the more nuanced emotions that a single genre can contain and so decided to make an app based off feels and theme rather than broad categories like action, romance, fantasy, and the like.

It's my hope that this will inspire a more emotionally intelligent way of categorizing media we consume and understand ourselves better in the process.
